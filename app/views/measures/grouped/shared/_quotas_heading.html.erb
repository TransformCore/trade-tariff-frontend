      Quotas allow a limited amount of goods to be imported at a lower duty rate. Once the quota has been used up, you will revert to your out-of-quota rate â€“ which may be the third country duty or a preferential rate.
    </p>
    <p class='govuk-body'>
      Quotas can be non-preferential (open to many countries) or preferential (restricted to a particular trading partner).
